* Curriculum Vitae

These are the sources to generate my CV, I forked [[https://github.com/sneas/cv-template/][this template]].
The layout was completely rewritten by me.

The building and release process is automatically triggered on new
commit on the ~master~ branch.
Building produces the static website folder and a ~pdf~ file, both are
released using [[https://pages.github.com][GitHub Pages]] at [[https://cv.aciceri.dev]] and on the IPFS
network.

Test locally with ~npm run start~
