\item Created and worked on different internal tools touching a variety of technologies including Haskell, Cardano, Purescript and Nix.
\item Worked on the Nix interpreter and on Hydra (a Nix CI tool) as part of a Catalyst proposal.
\item Leaded the development of two Nix-related open source tools for Cardano (cardano.nix and spo-anywhere).
