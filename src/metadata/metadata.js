    interests: `
As person who studied math and computer science I enjoy analyzing and formalizing problems and puzzles looking for optimal solutions, this applies to every aspect of my life, even my personal life.
When I was younger I studied music, and even if now only as a listener, I continue to marvel at its expressive possibilities in all its genres. I made this interest collide with my attitude tried programming simple sequencers and synthesizers. 
I'm fond of science fiction books but sometimes I also enjoy the great classics, I also like Cinema. 
It's been a few years that I run and I've even partecipated in some races, I think that devote few hours a week to my pshysical well-being allows for a greater mental efficiency.
